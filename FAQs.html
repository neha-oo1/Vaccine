        <button class="accordion ">Is a COVID vaccine scheduled anytime soon?</button>
        <div class="panel dp">
            <p>Yes, vaccine trials are under different stages of finalization. Government of India is geared to launch a
                vaccine for COVID 19 soon. For more information and updates visit www.mohfw.gov.in</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Will COVID 19 vaccine be given to everyone simultaneously?</button>
        <div class="panel dp">
            <p>
                Based on the potential availability of vaccines the Government of India has selected the priority groups
                who
                will be vaccinated on priority as they are at higher risk.

                The first group includes healthcare and frontline workers. The second group to receive COVID 19 vaccine
                will
                be persons over 50 years of age and persons under 50 years with comorbid conditions.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Is it mandatory to take the vaccine?</button>
        <div class="panel dp">
            <p>Vaccination for COVID-19 is voluntary. However, it is advisable to receive the complete schedule of
                COVID-19
                vaccine for protecting one-self against this disease and also to limit the spread of this disease to the
                close contacts
                including family members, friends, relatives and co-workers.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Will the vaccine be safe as it is being tested and introduced in a short span of
            time?</button>
        <div class="panel dp">
            <p>
                Vaccines will be introduced in the country only after the regulatory bodies clear it based on its safety
                and efficacy.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">Can a person presently having COVID-19 (confirmed or suspected) infection be
            vaccinated?</button>
        <div class="panel dp">
            <p>Person with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 infection may increase the risk of spreading the same to
                others at vaccination site. For this reason, infected individuals should defer vaccination for 14 days
                after symptoms
                resolution.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">Is it necessary for a COVID recovered person to take the vaccine?</button>
        <div class="panel dp">
            <p>Yes, it is advisable to receive complete schedule of COVID vaccine irrespective of past history of
                infection with COVID-19. This will help in developing a strong immune response against the disease.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">Out of the multiple vaccines available, how is one or more vaccine chosen for
            administration?</button>
        <div class="panel dp">
            <p>The safety and efficacy data from clinical trials of vaccine candidates are examined by Drug regulator of
                our country before granting the license for the same. Hence, all the COVID-19 vaccines that receive
                license will have
                comparable safety and efficacy.

                However, it must be ensured that the entire schedule of vaccination is completed by only one type of
                vaccine as different COVID-19 vaccines are not interchangeable.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">How will I know if I am eligible for vaccination?</button>
        <div class="panel dp">
            <p>In the initial phase, COVID 19 vaccine will be provided to the priority group- Health Care and Front-line
                workers.

                The 50 plus age group may also begin early based on vaccine availability.

                The eligible beneficiaries will be informed through their registered mobile number regarding the Health
                Facility where the vaccination will be provided and the scheduled time for the same. This will be done
                to avoid any inconvenience in registration and vaccination of beneficiaries.</p>
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">Will a Photo / ID be required at the time of registration?</button>
        <div class="panel dp">
            <p>
                The Photo ID produced at the time of registration must be produced and verified at the time of
                vaccination.
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">Are there any preventive measures and precautions that one needs to follow at the
            session site?</button>
        <div class="panel dp">
            <p>
                We request you to rest at the vaccination centre for atleast half an hour after taking the COVID-19
                vaccine. Inform the nearest health authorities / ANM / ASHA in case you feel any discomfort or
                uneasiness subsequently.

                Remember to continue following key COVID Appropriate Behaviours like wearing of mask, maintaining hand
                sanitization and physical distance (or 6 feet or Do Gaj).
        </div>
        <button class="accordion">What about the possible side-effects from COVID-19 vaccine?</button>
        <div class="panel dp">
            <p>
                COVID Vaccine will be introduced only when the safety is proven. As is true for other vaccines, the
                common side effects in some individuals could be mild fever, pain, etc. at the site of injection.

                States have been asked to start making arrangements to deal with any Covid-19 vaccine-related
                side-effects as one of the measures towards safe vaccine delivery among masses.
